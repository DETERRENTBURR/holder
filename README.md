## Project Overview

This project showcases a **minimalistic clip holder** designed to grip small materials, from paper to textiles. Due to the absence of a spring mechanism, its holding strength is limited, making it suitable for lightweight and moderately thick materials.  

The focus of this design is **simplicity**, **ease of manufacturing**, and the potential for future improvement. Adding a spring could significantly enhance its functionality, making it more versatile.

## 🎨 Design and Creation Process

### Designed in Rhino
The clip was modeled in **Rhino** using simple geometric operations, such as cutting out sections from a rectangular prism.

### Printed with Prusa
The model was printed on a **Prusa 3D printer** using **PrusaSlicer**. The printing process took approximately **10 minutes**.

## 📸 Final Result

The final product is a small, practical clip suitable for lightweight tasks. While functional, adding a spring would make it capable of holding thicker and heavier materials.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download the STL file and open it in your 3D slicer software.
2. Configure printing settings (recommended layer height: 0.2 mm).
3. Print the model using any 3D printer.
4. *(Optional)* Add a spring to enhance its grip strength.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Incorporate a compression mechanism (spring or elastic band).  
- Adjust the dimensions for holding thicker materials.  
- Experiment with alternative printing materials (PLA, PETG, ABS)
